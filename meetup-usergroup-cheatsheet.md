# Cheat Sheet: Creating a Meetup Group

1. Check whether there is a [user group or meetup already in your area](https://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups)

2. If no group exists that meets your needs **create a new group** by following the below steps ([more details here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/StartingYourUsersGroup))

3. Join the [organizers email list](http://mail.python.org/mailman/private/group-organizers/2007-June/000003.html) here

4. Define the group name - usually Python CITY_NAME

5. Make a **group website** (preferably with your own domain name), so you can include the URL when promoting the group. 

6. Define a **meeting location**. It's good to have a location you can rely upon, monthly, without fail. 
    * Businesses that are heavily invested in your technology may sponsor your group. 
    * Libraries often have space available, although their hours can be limited. 
    * Bars may host groups on off-nights - they can see it as a way to fill their bar with people.
    * Coworking spaces are often a good choice as well, as they want their members to be able to network.

7. Define **the style of meetings for the group**. Decide on the flavor of your meetings. There are lots of different things to do at meetings.
    * Presenters
    * Lightning talks
    * Code reviews
    * Display videos
    * Standard module of the month
    * Some people are looking for social opportunities. 
        *In Dallas they hold social gatherings once a month, an evening at a local restaurant. 

    * Others want something more in-depth; 
        * They hold twice-monthly Saturday afternoon sesssions at a local bookstore that has wireless. Sometimes they have presentations and other times sprints, with hands-on coding.
    * Some people find it works not to have a topic but just have people talk about what they've found interesting and what they're working on.
    * Often groups meet for beer/food before and/or after the meeting, to give people a chance to congregate and hang out after the meeting place has closed.
    * Group activities:
        * Put together a club website using one of the many Python web frameworks.
        * Establish a club mailing list, wiki and subversion repository.
        * Consider producing audio recordings ala podcasts, an especially good option if your group is geographically dispersed or cannot agree on meeting times/locations.
        * Work to run a "scripting conference" in your area, bringing together proponents of the various languages. Some people will convert, either because your group looks like more fun or Python is such a cool language.
        * Work to run a "web technology conference" in your area, bringing together proponents of the various approaches. Many just want *something* to easily produce web sites and if Python is more friendly, they'll give it a try.

8. Find more people to become part of **the organizers team**. Getting a second person to sign up as a core organizer helps prevent your own burn-out, and reduces the 'bus number', for when you are indisposed. (on holiday, hospitalized, etc)

9. Define the means to **promote the group**.
    * Create a chapter on python.meetup.com. Such chapters cost per month; some say $19.95/month but in Houston they are paying $9.95/month so far. It's a good way for people to find you though, and you can take donations from the membership. In the DFW Pythoneers, they have found many of their members via this method.(Much the same is true for Houston.) 
        * Apply for a grant from the PSF for meetup fees if needed. Go to https://www.python.org/psf/grants/ for more information on what grants cover and information about how to apply for one.
    * Standard ways of communicating meetings (i.e. you don't have to use one of the above sites):
    * For each meeting or other event, post an email to mail.python.org email lists "python-announce" and "python-list". While, in my experience, many are not on these lists, it reaches another subset of the Python community you can't reach any other way. (These are mirrored to Google groups comp.lang.python.announce and comp.lang.python)
    * Other mailing lists, newsgroups, twitter, RSS, etc.
    * Add your group in LocalUserGroups. Some people come here to find such groups.
    * Identify other user groups in your area and, with their permission, post an announcement of your meetings. For DFW Pythoneers we use the DFW Unix Users Group, and need to start making use of the .NET Users Group, the Apple Users Group and the North Texas Linux Users Group.
    * Hang some flyers at your local college; hold some meetings on a campus and get listed as a campus organization.
    * Produce some podcasts (or even better screencasts) and get them listed on video.google.com, Python 411 and such. Be sure to edit in a publicity blurb about your user group.
    * Set up a Google adwords (or similar) campaign targeting your local geographic area for search terms such as Python, Java, and scripting. Keeping the spread local keeps the cost reasonable. We targeted the province of Manitoba in Canada, population 1 million, for http://WinniPUG.ca, both Python and Java, for about $60 per year, and it generated a lot of interest. We pass a hat at meetings to cover the cost.
    * Consider putting your group on facebook, upcoming, and other places. Note that there is a cost to putting your energies into keeping these multiple places up to date, but it can get you users who would otherwise not find you. So you need to balance your time constraints to your desire to grow the size of the group.
